## Overview

This is a robust and secure backend application designed to power a blogging platform. Built with Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Hibernate, it provides a comprehensive set of APIs for managing blog posts and user roles. The application utilizes MySQL for data persistence and implements JWT authentication for secure API access.

## Key Features

* **Post Management:**
    * Users can create new blog posts and assign them to specific categories.
    * Users have the ability to manage their own blog posts (edit, delete).
    * Users can view a list of their own created posts.
* **Enhanced Post Retrieval:**
    * Implementation of pagination to efficiently handle a large number of posts.
    * Searching functionality to find posts based on keywords.
    * Sorting capabilities to order posts based on different criteria.
    * Informative messaging is provided during post retrieval to indicate the status and any relevant details.
* **Role-Based API Security:**
    * Dedicated APIs tailored for different user roles (Admin and Normal User).
    * JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication implemented to secure all API endpoints, ensuring only authorized users can access specific functionalities.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The primary programming language.
* **Spring Boot:** A framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications.
* **Spring Security:** Provides authentication and authorization.
* **Hibernate:** An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database interaction.
* **MySQL:** A relational database management system for persistent data storage.
* **Postman:** Used for testing and interacting with the API endpoints.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure authentication and authorization.

## Getting Started (Optional - if you want to include setup instructions)

**(You can add specific instructions here on how to clone, build, and run the application. For example:)**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Udit-singh/Blog-App.git](https://github.com/Udit-singh/Blog-App.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Blog-App
    ```
3.  **Build the application (using Maven):**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4.  **Configure the database:**
    * Ensure you have a running MySQL instance.
    * Update the database connection properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`) with your MySQL credentials.
5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
6.  **Access the API:**
    * You can use Postman or any other HTTP client to interact with the API endpoints. Refer to the API documentation (you might want to create a separate API documentation file or section).

## API Endpoints (Optional - you can list some key endpoints)

**(Example - you can list some of the main API endpoints and their purpose):**

* `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.
* `POST /api/auth/register`: Registers a new user.
* `POST /api/users/{userId}/posts`: Create a new post for a specific user (requires user role).
* `GET /api/posts`: Get all posts (with pagination, searching, and sorting).
* `GET /api/users/{userId}/posts`: Get all posts by a specific user (requires authentication).
* `PUT /api/posts/{postId}`: Update a specific post (requires user or admin role).
* `DELETE /api/posts/{postId}`: Delete a specific post (requires user or admin role).
* `GET /api/admin/users`: Get all users (requires admin role).

## Further Development (Optional - if you have plans for the future)

**(You can mention any future features or improvements you plan to implement, such as:)**

* Adding support for image uploads.
* Implementing comment functionality.
* Creating a frontend interface (e.g., using React, Angular, Vue.js).
* Adding more advanced search filters.
